Project Description: Restaurant Data Analysis
Objective:
The aim of this project is to analyze restaurant data to gain insights into menu pricing, order trends, and customer behavior. This analysis is structured into three main objectives:

Explore the Items Table:

Goals:
Determine the number of rows in the items table.
Identify the least and most expensive items.
Categorize item prices within each category.
Approach:
Utilize SQL queries to count rows, find minimum and maximum prices, and group items by category to assess price distribution.
Explore the Orders Table:

Goals:
Find the date range of orders.
Calculate the number of items within each order.
Identify orders with the highest number of items.
Approach:
Use SQL queries to determine the range of dates, count items per order, and rank orders by item count to highlight the largest orders.
Analyze Customer Behavior:

Goals:
Combine the items and orders tables to find the least and most ordered categories.
Investigate the details of the highest spend orders.
Approach:
Join the items and orders tables to perform category-wise analysis of order frequency and identify orders with the highest total spend.
Methodology:
Data Exploration:

Use SQL to explore and understand the structure and contents of the items and orders tables.
Perform descriptive statistics to summarize key information about prices and order patterns.
Data Analysis:

Conduct detailed analysis by writing SQL queries to answer specific questions related to each objective.
Aggregate and visualize data where applicable to uncover trends and patterns.
Customer Insights:

Combine insights from both tables to understand customer preferences and spending behavior.
Identify key categories driving sales and analyze high-value orders for deeper insights.
Expected Outcomes:
Comprehensive understanding of item pricing and categorization.
Detailed insights into order patterns and trends.
Identification of key customer behavior metrics, such as most and least ordered categories and high-value orders.
Actionable insights for optimizing menu offerings and improving customer satisfaction.
